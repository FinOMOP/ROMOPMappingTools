# Intro

This vignette shows how to use some of the functions of the ROMOPMappingTools package to work with a single Usagi mapping file.
Reading and Usagi file, validating its format, or updating it after a vocabulary update. 
For trasforming a single usagi file into C&CR tables of the OMOP vocabulary, we recommend follow the same steps as in the [Work with multiple mapping files](workWithMultipleMappingFiles.html) vignette.
This is because the process need some other information that is not included in the Usagi file, but n the 'vocabularies.csv' file.
For automating all the process in a github repository, please refer to the [Work as a github repository](workAsGithubRepo.html) vignette.

Example files are included in the package. In the `inst/testdata` folder you can find the files used in this example.

## Reading a Usagi file

For reading the Usagi file, we can use the `readUsagiFile` function, which returns a tibble with the correct columns formated.
It can read a standard Usagi file or an extended Usagi file, see the [Usagi file format](usagiFileFormat.html) vignette for more details.
In this example we will read a extended Usagi file, from the test data.
This file contains the mappings for the ICD10fi vocabulary.

```{r}
pathToUsagiFile <- system.file("testdata/VOCABULARIES/ICD10fi/ICD10fi.usagi.csv", package = "ROMOPMappingTools")

usagiTibble <- readUsagiFile(pathToUsagiFile)

usagiTibble |> dplyr::glimpse()
```

## Validating a Usagi file

To validate if all the information in the Usagi file is correct, we can use the `validateUsagiFile` function. 
This function takes an Usagi or Usagi-extended file and and performs a series of validations, see the function help for more details `?validateUsagiFile`.
The function also needs a connection to the OMOP vocabulary database and schema to where the vocabulary tables are stored in order to make some of the validations.
The function also need the number used to offset the source concept ids in the Usagi file.
The function returns a tibble with a summary of the validations conducted and if error are found, a new Usagi file with the errors will be created in the specified path.

For this example, we will use the test database in DuckDB format included in the package.
This test database contains only the ICD10 vocabulary with all the keys in other tables (see `inst/testdata/createTestData.R` for more details).

```{r}
pathToOMOPVocabularyDuckDBfile <-  helper_createATemporaryCopyOfTheOMOPVocabularyDuckDB()

connectionDetails <- DatabaseConnector::createConnectionDetails(
    dbms = "duckdb",
    server = pathToOMOPVocabularyDuckDBfile
)

connection <- DatabaseConnector::connect(connectionDetails)
vocabularyDatabaseSchema <- "main"

pathToValidatedUsagiFile  <- tempfile(fileext = "usagi_validated.csv")
```

```{r}
validationsSummary <- validateUsagiFile(
  pathToUsagiFile,
  connection,
  vocabularyDatabaseSchema,
  pathToValidatedUsagiFile = pathToValidatedUsagiFile, 
  sourceConceptIdOffset = 2000500000
)
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(validationsSummary)
```

In this case the Usagi file is valid and no errors are found. Hence, the new validated Usagi file remains unchanged.

However, we can see what happens with a usagi file with errors.
In this case we use an other Usagi file with all type of errors, wich is included in the package for unit testing purposes.

```{r}
pathToUsagiFileWithErrors <- system.file("testdata/VOCABULARIES/ICD10fi/ICD10fi_with_errors.usagi.csv", package = "ROMOPMappingTools")

usagiTibbleWithErrors <- readUsagiFile(pathToUsagiFileWithErrors)
```

```{r}
validationsSummaryWithErrors <- validateUsagiFile(
  pathToUsagiFileWithErrors,
  connection,
  vocabularyDatabaseSchema,
  pathToValidatedUsagiFile = pathToValidatedUsagiFile,
  sourceConceptIdOffset = 2000500000
)
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(validationsSummaryWithErrors)
```

In this case, if we open the new validate Usagi with the Usagi software these mapping with errors will appear as FLAGGED.
Additionally, the `ADD_INFO:validationMessages` column will indicate the exact error or errors found.

## Updating a Usagi file

If the vocabulary has been updated since the Usagi file was created, it may happen that some of the mappings are outdated.
This will be detected by the `validateUsagiFile` and show as a "ConceptIds outdated" error. 

In this case we will use an other Usagi file with outdated concept ids, which is included in the package for unit testing purposes.

```{r}
pathToOutdatedUsagiFile <- system.file("testdata/VOCABULARIES/ICD10fi/ICD10fi_outdated.usagi.csv", package = "ROMOPMappingTools")

validationsSummaryWithErrors <- validateUsagiFile(
  pathToOutdatedUsagiFile,
  connection,
  vocabularyDatabaseSchema,
  pathToValidatedUsagiFile = pathToValidatedUsagiFile,
  sourceConceptIdOffset = 2000500000
)

knitr::kable(validationsSummaryWithErrors)
```

If outdated error are detected, we can attempt to update the Usagi file automatically using the `updateUsagiFile` function.
This function takes an Usagi or Usagi-extended file, a connection to the database, the schema with the vocabulary tables and a path to a file where to store the updated Usagi file.

```{r}
pathToUpdatedUsagiFile <- tempfile(fileext = "usagi_updated.csv")

updateSummary <- updateUsagiFile(
    pathToOutdatedUsagiFile, 
    connection,
    vocabularyDatabaseSchema,
    pathToUpdatedUsagiFile,
    skipValidation = TRUE
  )

knitr::kable(updateSummary)
```

This fuction updates changes in `domain_id`, `concept_name` and if the mapped `concept_id` point to a non-standard concept it will try to find a new mapping for it
(This is done by looking at the relationship table for relationships of the old concept_id by "Maps to", "Concept replaced by", "Concept same_as to" and "Concept poss_eq to" in that order).
A new column `ADD_INFO:autoUpdatingInfo` is added to the updated Usagi file to show the specific changes made to the file.

Some times, like in this case, a new concept_id can not be found, this is shown as a warning.

The new updates Usagi file can be validated again with the `validateUsagiFile` function to check if there are any errors.

```{r}
validationsSummaryWithErrors <- validateUsagiFile(
  pathToUpdatedUsagiFile,
  connection,
  vocabularyDatabaseSchema,
  pathToValidatedUsagiFile = pathToValidatedUsagiFile,
  sourceConceptIdOffset = 2000500000
)

knitr::kable(validationsSummaryWithErrors)
```

Unfortunatelly, sometimes the updateUsagiFile is introducing new errors, in this case updates in the vocabulary have introduced invalid domain combinations. 
Moreover, some of the mappings could not be updated because the new concept_id was not found.
This need to be fixed by the user by reviewing the Usagi file.
