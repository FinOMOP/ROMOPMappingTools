<p>This vignette explains the steps to process a repository with
vocabulary mappings. It transforms mapping files in usagi-extended
format to the OMOP vocabulary tables, appends then to an OMOP vocabulary
downloaded from Athena, run some QC, calculates codes coverage from
databases, and builds the status dashboard.</p>
<p>In this example we use the demo repository <a href="github.com/FinOMOP/FinOMOP_OMOP_vocabulary_test">FinOMOP_OMOP_vocabulary_test</a>.</p>
<p>Notice that this is a guide to understand the package functions. For
the use of the package in a running environment, the demo repository
already contains the same steps in the internal processing scrip <a href="https://github.com/FinOMOP/FinOMOP_OMOP_vocabulary_test/blob/development/SCRIPTS/R_repo_management/R_scripts/update_repository.R" class="external-link">update_repository.R</a></p>

<p>If <code>n_failed_rules</code>&gt;0 it means there is an error in the
table format. The specific error can be seen by looking at
<code>failed_rules_table</code> column.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can use <code>autoFixDatabaseCodeCountTable</code>
function to fix some of the common mistakes in the code_counts tables.
It is recommended to replace the code_counts.csv file with the fixed

</h3>
<p>Once the code_counts tables are valid they can be used to assess how
the new merged vocabulary covers the event in each database. For this we
need a database_coverage.csv file that describes the vocabularies to
assess.</p>
<p>The database_coverage.csv file has the following columns: -
source_vocabulary_id: vocabulary id as it appears in the code_counts
files - target_vocabulary_ids: vocabulary id as it appears in the
concept table - mantained_by: maintainer of the vocabulary, eg “OMOP” -
ignore: ignore column if TRUE</p>
<p>A source_vocabulary_id may have more than one target_vocabulary_ids.
This is use to contemplate extension vocabularies. For example, the
ICD10fi vocabulary is an extension of the ICD10 vocabulary. Adding two
columns, for source_vocabulary_id=“CID10fi”, one with
target_vocabulary_ids=“ICD10” and other with
target_vocabulary_ids=“ICD10fi”, tells that a “ICD10fi” code in the code
counts may be found in the ICD10 or the ICD10fi vocabulary in the
concept table.</p>
